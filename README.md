SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does

    - The tutorial must include sections that correspond to each of the components that make up the regex. You may not need to use all of the sections included in the starter code, but you should include all of the sections that correspond to the different components of the regex you chose.

    - Each section that describes a component must include more than just one sentence explaining what it does. It’s okay to use online resources for assistance, but do not copy and paste; explain each component in your own words and be thorough.

    - Each section that describes a component must include a code snippet of that particular component. Use backticks to display your code snippets in Markdown.

    - Each section that describes a component must include at least one example that meets the requirements of that component.
